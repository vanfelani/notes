In the article sourced above we can know the history of SQL naming from the first relational databases came into existence with E.F. Codd’s 1970 publication “A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks.” While Codd’s ideas were remarkable for the time, in San Jose, California, two colleagues named Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce were developing SQUARE (Specifying Queries As Relational Expressions) – a query language. By 1974 they published the query language SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language) based on SQUARE. Unfortunately, due to trademark violations on the acronym SEQUEL, which was already registered by the Hawker Siddeley aircraft company, the name was changed to Structured Query Language and abbreviated as SQL.

So, SQL has a long history of changing it's name, with a lot of people have worked in developing this query language. Many argument: “If I was using Sequel, I’d call it “sequel.” I’m using SQL, so I call it S.Q.L.” People can let their imaginations run wild inventing more pronunciations: let go their imagination inventing more: squall, sqwool, sqwll, squirrel.
> **conslusion: it's fine to pronounce it either SQL or SEQUEL**


### Learning SQL JOIN Commands
in the previous lesson, we've been learning a little about **DDL AND DML**, and we already have some table named item,stock, and unit with the structure below:
```
ITEM TABLE
+-------+------------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field | Type             | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+-------+------------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| id    | int(10) unsigned | NO   | PRI | NULL    |       |
| name  | varchar(30)      | NO   |     | NULL    |       |
+-------+------------------+------+-----+---------+-------+

STOCK TABLE
+---------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field   | Type             | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
+---------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| id      | int(11)          | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
| item_id | int(10) unsigned | NO   | MUL | NULL    |                |
| qty     | int(11)          | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
| unit_id | int(10) unsigned | NO   | MUL | NULL    |                |
+---------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+

UNIT TABLE
+-------+------------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field | Type             | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+-------+------------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| id    | int(10) unsigned | NO   | PRI | NULL    |       |
| name  | varchar(20)      | NO   |     | NULL    |       |
+-------+------------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
```

>> and we already learn how to input, edit and delete data into the table, hence we already have the data like table below:

```
DATA IN ITEM TABLE
+----+----------------+
| id | name           |
+----+----------------+
|  1 | Indomie Goreng |
|  2 | Nescafe        |
|  3 | Gula Pasir     |
+----+----------------+

DATA IN STOCK TABLE
+----+---------+-----+---------+
| id | item_id | qty | unit_id |
+----+---------+-----+---------+
|  1 |       1 |  80 |       2 |
|  2 |       1 | 100 |       2 |
|  3 |       1 | 500 |       2 |
|  4 |       2 |  40 |       2 |
|  5 |       3 |  90 |       1 |
|  6 |       3 |  90 |       4 |
+----+---------+-----+---------+

DATA IN UNIT TABLE 
+----+-------+
| id | name  |
+----+-------+
|  1 | g     |
|  2 | pack  |
|  3 | litre |
|  4 | kg    |
+----+-------+

```

## What is joined table in SQL?

In SQL we compose relations: we build a new relation from two existing ones. Remember, a relation is a collection of objects. How would you compose two collections of objects together to form a new collection of objects?

There aren’t that many ways to do it. Both input collections have objects of certain properties, or attributes. You typically want to build a new collection of objects that would have properties from the two collections, right?

**That’s it. That’s a SQL JOIN.**

Remember in the last lesson we also already learn what is **FOREIGN KEY**, Foreign key is a key we use to two or more table. With the existence of foreign key in the tables, we could compose a new collection of objects or so we called **joining the tables**.

Join table have several format we can use depend on the the case, as you can see in this image below:
<a href="https://www.vertabelo.com/blog/sql-or-sequel/"><img src="https://theartofpostgresql.com/img/SQL-JOINS-Example-0.png" title="SQL History" alt="SQL History"></a>

### INNER JOIN
> Returns records that have matching values in both tables, The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both the tables as long as the condition satisfies.

```
example:
    SELECT * FROM stock s INNER JOIN unit u ON s.unit_id = u.id;
+----+---------+-----+---------+----+------+
| id | item_id | qty | unit_id | id | name |
+----+---------+-----+---------+----+------+
|  1 |       1 |  80 |       2 |  2 | pack |
|  2 |       1 | 100 |       2 |  2 | pack |
|  3 |       1 | 500 |       2 |  2 | pack |
|  4 |       2 |  40 |       2 |  2 | pack |
|  5 |       3 |  90 |       1 |  1 | g    |
|  6 |       3 |  90 |       4 |  4 | kg   |
+----+---------+-----+---------+----+------+

From that query above we could get a combined tabled between stock table and unit table.
The column id of unit table act as the foreign key for table stock to link 
this two table, hence we get returns of all records of table stock and the matched 
data of unit table from the foreign key. 
```

### LEFT JOIN
> This join returns all the rows of the table on the left side of the join and matching rows for the table on the right side of join. The rows for which there is no matching row on right side, the result-set will contain null. LEFT JOIN is also known as LEFT OUTER JOIN.
```
example:
     SELECT * FROM stock s LEFT JOIN unit u ON s.unit_id = u.id;
+----+---------+-----+---------+------+------+
| id | item_id | qty | unit_id | id   | name |
+----+---------+-----+---------+------+------+
|  1 |       1 |  80 |       2 |    2 | pack |
|  2 |       1 | 100 |       2 |    2 | pack |
|  3 |       1 | 500 |       2 |    2 | pack |
|  4 |       2 |  40 |       2 |    2 | pack |
|  5 |       3 |  90 |       1 |    1 | g    |
|  6 |       3 |  90 |       4 |    4 | kg   |
+----+---------+-----+---------+------+------+
From the query above we can conclude that left join is basically similar to inner join 
we try before. And we even could just type `JOIN` for the same result.
example:
    SELECT * FROM stock s INNER JOIN unit u ON s.unit_id = u.id;
    SELECT * FROM stock s LEFT JOIN unit u ON s.unit_id = u.id;
    SELECT * FROM stock s JOIN unit u ON s.unit_id = u.id;
```

### RIGHT JOIN
> RIGHT JOIN is similar to LEFT JOIN but it's the oposite. This join returns all the rows of the table on the right side of the join and matching rows for the table on the left side of join. The rows for which there is no matching row on left side, the result-set will contain null. RIGHT JOIN is also known as RIGHT OUTER JOIN.

```
example;
     SELECT * FROM stock s RIGHT JOIN unit u ON s.unit_id = u.id;
+------+---------+------+---------+----+-------+
| id   | item_id | qty  | unit_id | id | name  |
+------+---------+------+---------+----+-------+
|    5 |       3 |   90 |       1 |  1 | g     |
|    1 |       1 |   80 |       2 |  2 | pack  |
|    2 |       1 |  100 |       2 |  2 | pack  |
|    3 |       1 |  500 |       2 |  2 | pack  |
|    4 |       2 |   40 |       2 |  2 | pack  |
| NULL |    NULL | NULL |    NULL |  3 | litre |
|    6 |       3 |   90 |       4 |  4 | kg    |
+------+---------+------+---------+----+-------+

The query above we can spot the different from the existence of null value in
the left side on the composed table object of stock table and unit table. 
That because the stock table doesn't have data that matched with the id 3 of unit table.
```

### FULL JOIN / UNION
> Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table. BUT IN MYSQL we can't use this FULL JOIN but we still can emulate it by using the UNION clause. 
```
example:
    select id,name from item union select id, name from unit;
+----+----------------+
| id | name           |
+----+----------------+
|  1 | Indomie Goreng |
|  2 | Nescafe        |
|  3 | Gula Pasir     |
|  1 | g              |
|  2 | pack           |
|  3 | litre          |
|  4 | kg             |
+----+----------------+

The example above is using the union clause in order to emulate the full join clause in
MYSQL.
but union clause itself requires some condition that we must pay attention to:
1. must have same column 
2. must have same datatype per column
3. must in the same order

```

### CROSS JOIN / CARTESIAN JOIN
> The SQL CROSS JOIN produces a result set which is the number of rows in the first table multiplied by the number of rows in the second table if no WHERE clause is used along with CROSS JOIN.This kind of result is called as Cartesian Product.
```
example:
    select * from stock cross join unit;
+----+---------+-----+---------+----+-------+
| id | item_id | qty | unit_id | id | name  |
+----+---------+-----+---------+----+-------+
|  1 |       1 |  80 |       2 |  1 | g     |
|  1 |       1 |  80 |       2 |  2 | pack  |
|  1 |       1 |  80 |       2 |  3 | litre |
|  1 |       1 |  80 |       2 |  4 | kg    |
|  2 |       1 | 100 |       2 |  1 | g     |
|  2 |       1 | 100 |       2 |  2 | pack  |
|  2 |       1 | 100 |       2 |  3 | litre |
|  2 |       1 | 100 |       2 |  4 | kg    |
|  3 |       1 | 500 |       2 |  1 | g     |
|  3 |       1 | 500 |       2 |  2 | pack  |
|  3 |       1 | 500 |       2 |  3 | litre |
|  3 |       1 | 500 |       2 |  4 | kg    |
|  4 |       2 |  40 |       2 |  1 | g     |
|  4 |       2 |  40 |       2 |  2 | pack  |
|  4 |       2 |  40 |       2 |  3 | litre |
|  4 |       2 |  40 |       2 |  4 | kg    |
|  5 |       3 |  90 |       1 |  1 | g     |
|  5 |       3 |  90 |       1 |  2 | pack  |
|  5 |       3 |  90 |       1 |  3 | litre |
|  5 |       3 |  90 |       1 |  4 | kg    |
|  6 |       3 |  90 |       4 |  1 | g     |
|  6 |       3 |  90 |       4 |  2 | pack  |
|  6 |       3 |  90 |       4 |  3 | litre |
|  6 |       3 |  90 |       4 |  4 | kg    |
+----+---------+-----+---------+----+-------+
```

### SELF JOIN
> A self JOIN is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself.
```
example:
    SELECT a.item_id AS item_A, b.item_id AS item_B, a.id from stock a,stock b where a.id = b.id;
+--------+--------+----+
| item_A | item_B | id |
+--------+--------+----+
|      1 |      1 |  1 |
|      1 |      1 |  2 |
|      1 |      1 |  3 |
|      2 |      2 |  4 |
|      3 |      3 |  5 |
|      3 |      3 |  6 |
+--------+--------+----+
```

### JOINING ALL TABLES
```
example:
select i.id, i.name,s.qty,u.name as unit from item i
    -> join stock s on s.item_id=i.id
    -> join unit u on u.id=s.unit_id;
+----+----------------+-----+------+
| id | name           | qty | unit |
+----+----------------+-----+------+
|  1 | Indomie Goreng |  80 | pack |
|  1 | Indomie Goreng | 100 | pack |
|  1 | Indomie Goreng | 500 | pack |
|  2 | Nescafe        |  40 | pack |
|  3 | Gula Pasir     |  90 | g    |
|  3 | Gula Pasir     |  90 | kg   |
+----+----------------+-----+------+
```

### COUNT, SUM, GROUP BY AND HAVING CLAUSE

 - COUNT : can be used to count the records.
 - SUM : can be used to sum a column that have been grouped.
 - GROUP BY : to group records by a column.

```
    -COUNT
        select count(id) from item;
     +-----------+
     | count(id) |
     +-----------+
     |         3 |
     +-----------+

    -SUM
        select i.id, i.name,s.qty,u.name as unit from item i
        join stock s on s.item_id=i.id
        join unit u on u.id=s.unit_id;
    +----+----------------+-----+------+
    | id | name           | qty | unit |
    +----+----------------+-----+------+
    |  1 | Indomie Goreng |  80 | pack |
    |  1 | Indomie Goreng | 100 | pack |
    |  1 | Indomie Goreng | 500 | pack |
    |  2 | Nescafe        |  40 | pack |
    |  3 | Gula Pasir     |  90 | g    |
    |  3 | Gula Pasir     |  90 | kg   |
    +----+----------------+-----+------+

    -GROUP BY
        select i.id, i.name,sum(s.qty) as qty, u.name as unit from item i
        join stock s on s.item_id=i.id join unit u on u.id = s.unit_id group by i.id,u.id;
    +----+----------------+------+------+
    | id | name           | qty  | unit |
    +----+----------------+------+------+
    |  1 | Indomie Goreng |  680 | pack |
    |  2 | Nescafe        |   40 | pack |
    |  3 | Gula Pasir     |   90 | g    |
    |  3 | Gula Pasir     |   90 | kg   |
    +----+----------------+------+------+

    -HAVING
        select i.id, i.name,sum(s.qty) as qty, u.name as unit 
        from item i join stock s on s.item_id=i.id 
        join unit u on u.id = s.unit_id group by i.id,u.id having unit = 'pack';
     +----+----------------+------+------+
     | id | name           | qty  | unit |
     +----+----------------+------+------+
     |  1 | Indomie Goreng |  680 | pack |
     |  2 | Nescafe        |   40 | pack |
     +----+----------------+------+------+

```

### VIEW, PROCEDURE, FUNCTION, AND TRIGGER

- VIEW :

  In SQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.

  A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.

   ```
  example:
  create view summary as select i.id, i.name,sum(s.qty) as qty, u.name as unit from item i
  join stock s on s.item_id=i.id join unit u on u.id = s.unit_id group by i.id,u.id;
  +----+----------------+------+------+
  | id | name           | qty  | unit |
  +----+----------------+------+------+
  |  1 | Indomie Goreng |  680 | pack |
  |  2 | Nescafe        |   40 | pack |
  |  3 | Gula Pasir     |   90 | kg   |
  +----+----------------+------+------+
    ```



- PROCEDURE :
  
  A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again.

  So if you have an SQL query that you write over and over again, save it as a stored procedure, and then just call it to execute it.

  You can also pass parameters to a stored procedure, so that the stored procedure can act based on the parameter value(s) that is passed.

  ```
  
  stored procedure:
    DELIMITER //                        -> to change the end of a command into //
    CREATE PROCEDURE summary_by_unit    -> create procedure
      -> (IN in_unit varchar(20))       -> parameter
      -> BEGIN                          -> begin the produre
      -> select i.id, i.name,sum(s.qty) as qty, u.name as unit from item i left join
      stock s on s.item_id = i.id left join unit u on u.id= s.unit_id 
      group by i.id,u.id having unit = in_unit;         -> the command
      -> END //                         -> end the procedure
    DELIMITER ;                         -> change the end of command into ;

    call summary_by_unit('g');          -> call the procedure
    +----+------------+------+------+
    | id | name       | qty  | unit |
    +----+------------+------+------+
    |  3 | Gula Pasir |   90 | g    |
    +----+------------+------+------+

    ```


- FUNCTION
  
  SQL Server has many built-in functions.

  This reference contains string, numeric, date, conversion, and some advanced functions in SQL Server.

    ```
    CREATE FUNCTION hello (s CHAR(20))
   RETURNS CHAR(50) DETERMINISTIC
   RETURN CONCAT('Hello, ',s,'!');  -> create the function

   CREATE TABLE names (id int, name varchar(20));  -> create a table for storing the name
   INSERT INTO names VALUES (1, 'Bob');
   INSERT INTO names VALUES (2, 'John');
   INSERT INTO names VALUES (3, 'Paul');

   SELECT hello(name) FROM names; -> call the function
    +--------------+
    | hello(name)  |
    +--------------+
    | Hello, Bob!  |
    | Hello, John! |
    | Hello, Paul! |
    +--------------+

    ```

 - TRIGGER
  
    A trigger is a stored procedure in database which automatically invokes whenever a special event in the database occurs. For example, a trigger can be invoked when a row is inserted into a specified table or when certain table columns are being updated.

    Syntax:
    ```
      - create trigger [trigger_name] 
      - [before | after]  
      - {insert | update | delete}  
      - on [table_name]  
      - [for each row]  
      - [trigger_body] 

      Explanation of syntax:

      1. create trigger [trigger_name]: Creates or replaces an existing trigger 
        with the trigger_name.
      1. [before | after]: This specifies when the trigger will be executed.
      2. {insert | update | delete}: This specifies the DML operation.
      3. on [table_name]: This specifies the name of the table associated with the trigger.
      4. [for each row]: This specifies a row-level trigger, i.e., the trigger will be executed 
        for each row being affected.
      1. [trigger_body]: This provides the operation to be performed as trigger is fired.    
    ```


     
   

 
    > BEFORE and AFTER of Trigger:
    BEFORE triggers run the trigger action before the triggering statement is run.
    AFTER triggers run the trigger action after the triggering statement is run.

    ```
    example:
    +-------+-------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+ 
    | Field | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra          | 
    +-------+-------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+ 
    | tid   | int(4)      | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment | 
    | name  | varchar(30) | YES  |     | NULL    |                | 
    | subj1 | int(2)      | YES  |     | NULL    |                | 
    | subj2 | int(2)      | YES  |     | NULL    |                | 
    | subj3 | int(2)      | YES  |     | NULL    |                | 
    | total | int(3)      | YES  |     | NULL    |                | 
    | per   | int(3)      | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
    +-------+-------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+


    create trigger stud_marks 
    before INSERT 
    on 
    Student 
    for each row 
    set Student.total = Student.subj1 + Student.subj2 + Student.subj3, Student.per =
    Student.total * 60 / 100;


    insert into Student values(0, "ABCDE", 20, 20, 20, 0, 0); -> insert into table

### TCL (TRANSACTION CONTROL LANGUAGE)

Transaction Control Language commands are used to manage transactions in the database. These are used to manage the changes made by DML-statements. It also allows statements to be grouped together into logical transactions.

```
SET TRANSACTION: To start a transaction.
COMMIT: Commit command is used to permanently save any transaction
            into the database.
ROLLBACK: This command restores the database to last committed state.
            It is also used with savepoint command to jump to a savepoint
            in a transaction.
SAVEPOINT: Savepoint command is used to temporarily save a transaction so
            that you can rollback to that point whenever necessary.

```

### DCL (DATA CONTROL LANGUAGE)
A Data Control Language is a syntax similar to a computer programming language used to control access to data stored in a database (Authorization). In particular, it is a component of Structured Query Language (SQL).

```
GRANT: allow specified users to perform specified tasks.
REVOKE: cancel previously granted or denied permissions.

```
The operations for which privileges may be granted to or revoked from a user or role apply to both the Data definition language (DDL) and the Data manipulation language (DML), and may include CONNECT, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, EXECUTE and USAGE.


### NORMALIZATION

>Normalization Rule

```
Normalization rules are divided into the following normal forms:

- First Normal Form
- Second Normal Form
- Third Normal Form
- BCNF
- Fourth Normal Form

```
1. First Normal Form (1NF)
   
   For a table to be in the First Normal Form, it should follow the following 4 rules:
   ```
   1. It should only have single(atomic) valued attributes/columns.
   2. Values stored in a column should be of the same domain
   3. All the columns in a table should have unique names.
   4. And the order in which data is stored, does not matter.
   ```

2. Second Normal Form (2NF)
   
   For a table to be in the Second Normal Form,
   ```
    1. It should be in the First Normal form.
    2. And, it should not have Partial Dependency.

    In order to understand partial dependency, we need to know dependency first.

    Dependency is where a record have a field which can uniquely identify each 
    record in the table. In this case we can simply it's the PRIMARY KEY
    of the table that are satisfy that condition.

    This is Dependency and we also call it Functional Dependency.

    where an attribute in a table depends on only a part of the primary key 
    and not on the whole key that can be called with PARTIAL DEPENDENCY.

   ```
   **example:**

   <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
   <tbody><tr><th>score_id</th><th>student_id</th><th>subject_id</th><th>marks</th><th>teacher</th></tr>
   <tr><td>1</td><td>10</td><td>1</td><td>70</td><td>Java Teacher</td></tr>
   <tr><td>2</td><td>10</td><td>2</td><td>75</td><td>C++ Teacher</td></tr>
   <tr><td>3</td><td>11</td><td>1</td><td>80</td><td>Java Teacher</td></tr>
   </tbody></table>

   Now if you look at the Score table, we have a column **names teacher** which is only dependent on the subject, for Java it's Java Teacher and for C++ it's C++ Teacher & so on.

   Now as we just discussed that the primary key for this table is a composition of two columns which is **student_id & subject_id** but the teacher's name only depends on subject, hence the **subject_id**, and has nothing to do with **student_id**.

    **REMOVE PARTIAL DEPENDENCY**

    we have to separate the teachers name column from the score table, then add it into the subject table. So now the table will be like this:

   <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
   <tbody><tr><th>subject_id</th><th>subject_name</th><th>teacher</th></tr>
   <tr><td>1</td><td>Java</td><td>Java Teacher</td></tr>
   <tr><td>2</td><td>C++</td><td>C++ Teacher</td></tr>
   <tr><td>3</td><td>Php</td><td>Php Teacher</td></tr>
   </tbody></table>

   <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
   <tbody><tr><th>score_id</th><th>student_id</th><th>subject_id</th><th>marks</th></tr>
   <tr><td>1</td><td>10</td><td>1</td><td>70</td></tr>
   <tr><td>2</td><td>10</td><td>2</td><td>75</td></tr>
   <tr><td>3</td><td>11</td><td>1</td><td>80</td></tr>
   </tbody></table>


3. Third Normal Form (3NF)
   
   A table is said to be in the Third Normal Form when,

   ```
   1. It is in the Second Normal form.
   2. And, it doesn't have Transitive Dependency.

   ```

    > WHAT IS TRANSITIVE DEPEDENCY?
   <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
   <tbody><tr><th>score_id</th><th>student_id</th><th>subject_id</th><th>marks</th><th>exam_name</th><th>total_marks</th></tr>
   <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
   <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
   <tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
   </tbody></table>

    With **exam_name** and **total_marks** added to our Score table, it saves more data now. Primary key for our Score table is a composite key, which means it's made up of two attributes or columns → student_id + subject_id.

    The column **total_marks** depends on **exam_name** as with exam type the total score changes. For example, practicals are of less marks while theory exams are of more marks.

   But, **exam_name** is just another column in the score table. It is not a primary key or even a part of the primary key, and **total_marks** depends on it.

   This is **Transitive Dependency**. When a non-prime attribute depends on other non-prime attributes rather than depending upon the prime attributes or primary key.

   > How to remove Transitive Dependency?

   Take out the columns **exam_name** and **total_marks** from Score table and put them in an Exam table and use the exam_id wherever required.

   <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
   <tbody><tr><th>exam_id</th><th>exam_name</th><th>total_marks</th></tr>
   <tr><td>1</td><td>Workshop</td><td>200</td></tr>
   <tr><td>2</td><td>Mains</td><td>70</td></tr>
   <tr><td>3</td><td>Practicals</td><td>30</td></tr>
   </tbody></table>


4. Boyce and Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
   
   Boyce and Codd Normal Form is a higher version of the Third Normal form. This form deals with certain type of anomaly that is not handled by 3NF. A 3NF table which does not have multiple overlapping candidate keys is said to be in BCNF. For a table to be in BCNF, following conditions must be satisfied:

   ```
   1. R must be in 3rd Normal Form
   2. and, for each functional dependency ( X → Y ), X should be a super Key.

   ```
    example :
    <table class="table table-bordered">
      <tbody><tr><th>student_id</th><th>subject</th><th>professor</th></tr>
      <tr><td>101</td><td>Java</td><td>P.Java</td></tr>
      <tr><td>101</td><td>C++</td><td>P.Cpp</td></tr>
      <tr><td>102</td><td>Java</td><td>P.Java2</td></tr>
      <tr><td>103</td><td>C#</td><td>P.Chash</td></tr>
      <tr><td>104</td><td>Java</td><td>P.Java</td></tr>
      </tbody></table>


    In the table above, student_id, subject form primary key, which means subject column is a prime attribute.

    But, there is one more dependency, professor → subject.

    And while subject is a prime attribute, professor is a non-prime attribute, which is not allowed by BCNF.

    > How to satisfy BCNF?

    To make this relation(table) satisfy BCNF, we will decompose this table into two tables, student table and professor table.

   Below we have the structure for both the tables.

    #### student
    <table class="table table-bordered">
      <tbody><tr><th>student_id</th><th>p_id</th></tr>
      <tr><td>101</td><td>1</td></tr>
      <tr><td>101</td><td>2</td></tr>
      <tr><td colspan="2">and so on...</td></tr>
      </tbody></table>

    #### professor

      <table class="table table-bordered">
      <tbody><tr><th>p_id</th><th>professor</th><th>subject</th></tr>
      <tr><td>1</td><td>P.Java</td><td>Java</td></tr>
      <tr><td>2</td><td>P.Cpp</td><td>C++</td></tr>
      <tr><td colspan="3">and so on...</td></tr>
      </tbody></table>

5. Fourth Normal Form (4NF)

    A table is said to be in the Fourth Normal Form when,

   ```

   1. It is in the Boyce-Codd Normal Form.
   2. And, it doesn't have Multi-Valued Dependency.

   ```
    > WHAT IS MULTI-VALUED DEPENDENCY?

    <table class="table table-bordered">
   <tbody><tr><th>s_id</th><th>course</th><th>hobby</th></tr>
   <tr><td>1</td><td>Science</td><td>Cricket</td></tr>
   <tr><td>1</td><td>Maths</td><td>Hockey</td></tr>
   <tr><td>1</td><td>Science</td><td>Hockey</td></tr>
   <tr><td>1</td><td>Maths</td><td>Cricket</td></tr>
   </tbody></table>

   In the table above, there is no relationship between the columns course and hobby. They are independent of each other.

   So there is multi-value dependency, which leads to un-necessary repetition of data and other anomalies as well.

   > How to satisfy 4th Normal Form?

   To make the above relation satify the 4th normal form, we can decompose the table into 2 tables.
   
   #### course table
   <table class="table table-bordered">
   <tbody><tr><th>s_id</th><th>course</th></tr>
   <tr><td>1</td><td>Science</td></tr>
   <tr><td>1</td><td>Maths</td></tr>
   <tr><td>2</td><td>C#</td></tr>
   <tr><td>2</td><td>Php</td></tr>
   </tbody></table>

   #### hobbies table
   <table class="table table-bordered">
   <tbody><tr><th>s_id</th><th>hobby</th></tr>
   <tr><td>1</td><td>Cricket</td></tr>
   <tr><td>1</td><td>Hockey</td></tr>
   <tr><td>2</td><td>Cricket</td></tr>
   <tr><td>2</td><td>Hockey</td></tr>
   </tbody></table>
